##Challenge #4 Open Source Event Discovery Tool (Downtown Visions)


**Solve for:** Encouraging people to discover and attend new local events.


**Example Solution Direction:** Develop a calendar engine that produces an iCal feed that can be fed into an existing calendar tool (like Google or Outlook).


**Use-Case Overview:** People not knowing what is going on, be it entertainment, events, meetups, arts, etc. From a marketing perspective it is huge. We constantly here from consumers “I didn’t know about it”. From event planners, art venues we here “There is no central place to enter events and you spend 4 hours putting it into everyone’s event calendar.” “There is technology for this, but not across different platforms” I keep hearing, but find hard to understand. I’ve been pitched on a number of apps, but I haven’t seen a real solution.


**Assets:** Meetup.com iCal feeds; VisitWilmingtonDE.com/events; Facebook Ticketleap, and Eventbrite event discovery tools; Google Alerts


**Possible Technical Needs:** Rules-based decision engine; scraping data; iCal feeds; API integration; Facebook Graph API; machine learning
